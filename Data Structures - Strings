## To realize how long the string it is and what split do you want it, it's possible to use a built-in function such as len to discover it
fruit = 'banana'
print(len(fruit))
>> 6

x = len(fruit)
print(x)
>> 6

## To find out the letters and their positions in the string, it's possible to create a looping through strings 
fruit = 'banana'
index = 0
while index < len(fruit):
    letter = fruit[index]
    print(index, letter)
    index = index + 1
 
>> 0 b
>> 1 a
>> 2 n
>> 3 a
>> 4 n
>> 5 a

## Or in a more simple code, it's possible to looping through strings in such way:

fruit = 'banana'
for letter in fruit:
    print(letter)
>> b
>> a
>> n
>> a
>> n
>> a

# Looping and Counting
# This is a simple loop that loops through each letter in a string and counts the number of times the loop encounters the 'a' character

word = 'banana'
count = 0
for letter in word:
    if letter == 'a' :
        count = count + 1
print(count)

>> 3

# Slicing Strings
# M(0)o(1)n(2)t(3)y(4) (5)P(6)y(7)t(8)h(9)o(10)n(11)
# We can also look atany continuos section of a string using a colon operator
# The second number is one beyond the end of the slice - 'up to but not incluing'
# If the second number is beyond the end of the string, it stops at the end

s = 'Monty Python'

# Go to 0 until 4, but don't include 4
print(s[0:4])
>> Mont

# Go to 6 until 7, but don't include 4
print(s[6:7])
>> P

# Go 6 until 20, but don't include 4. Which is a perfect way to get until the end without get a error.
print(s[6:20])
>> Python

# Go to 0 until 2, but don't include 2
print(s[:2])
>> Mo

# Go to 8 until the end
print(s[8:])
>> thon

# Get all the string and print it.
print(s[:])
>> Monty Python
